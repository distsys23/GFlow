# Paper: GFlow: Hierarchical GNN-enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Privacy and Security-aware Workflow Scheduling

This is an implementation code for our paper entitled: *GFlow: Hierarchical GNN-enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Privacy and Security-aware Workflow Scheduling*

## Framework
<img src="https://github.com/distsys23/img/blob/main/GFlow/framework.png" alt="GFlow framework" style="width:70%;">

## Requirements
```
pip install torch==1.12.0
```

## Configuration
- Hyperparameters configuration file: `./parameter.py`

## Quick Start
```
python main.py
```

Directly run the `main.py`, the approach will run with the default settings.

## Data
Workflows data with `.xml` format located in folder [XML_Scientific_Workflow](https://github.com/distsys23/HOPS/tree/main/XML_Scientific_Workflow), including CyberShake, Epigenomics, LIGO, Montage, and SIPHT.

## Code Structure
- `Comparison_Algorithms`: comparison algorithms files.
- `XML_Scientific_Workflow`: data of scientific workflow.
- `preprocess`: functions of processing workflow data.
- `main.py`: main function for HOPS.
- `Q_learning_model.py`: Q-learning model for task prioritization phase.
- `Parameter.py`: hyperparameters configuration.
- `Environment.py`: environment file for workflow scheduling in hybrid clouds.
- `DQN_model.py`: DQN model for task allocation phase.
